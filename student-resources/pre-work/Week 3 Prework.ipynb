    "### What are the differences between a Correlation and a Linear Regression? Aren't they doing the same thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, they are not the same. They are similar, but achieve different goals. I'll break them down into similarities and differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similarities\n",
    "- The standardised regression coefficient is the same as Pearson's correlation coefficient\n",
    "- The square of Pearson's correlation coefficient is the same as the R^2 in simple linear regression\n",
    "- Neither simple linear regression nor correlation answer questions of causality directly. This point is important, because I've met people that think that simple regression can magically allow an inference that X causes Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences\n",
    "- Correlation quantifies the relationship between two variables. Correlation does not fit a line through the data.\n",
    "- Correlation typically refers to Pearson Correlation, but there are other correlations, such as Spearman's Correlation.\n",
    "- It does not matter whether you call which feature X or Y, you will get the same correlation if you swap them. With linear regression, you have to decide your independent/predictor variable (X) with your dependent/target variable (Y). You are looking for a best fit line that predicts Y from X, and it will definitely be different if you swap them around.\n",
    "- Linear Regression fits a best fit line to predict Y from X. If you were to bring in new data/samples, predictor X can help you predict the outcomes of Y, based off of previous data.\n",
    "- Although both correlation and linear regression does not answer causality directly, with linear regression you do have to think about causality to determine whether X is the best predictor for Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, if you are interested in seeing the magnitude of the relationship between X and Y, use correlation. If you are interested in predicting and explaining your results in particular values, use linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the differences between Simple Linear Regression/Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS)/Linear Least Squares? What about Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) and Linear Least Squares are the same thing. The goal is to reduce the error rate or the squares. Looks something like this: https://training-course-material.com/images/a/ac/Images-mod2-linear12.gif How is it different from Simple Linear Regression? Not much, they are practically the same thing. In order to reduce the error rate/squares in OLS, you have to use Simple Linear Regression or Multiple Linear Regression in a dataset. The only difference is SLR has 1 target and 1 predictor, where as MLR has 1 target and 2 or more predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is statistic interaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we multiplied 2 features together, that is called Statistical Interaction. The reason why we do this is to see if there is an interaction between the 2 features. We want to see if the effect of 1 independent variable will vary depending on the level of another independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This website provides some further insight on statistic interaction (the bottom of the page has graphs): \n",

    "2. Variance - I will try to account for all the data points in my current \"sample/training\" set.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias means that you are **underfitting**. You are obtaining only the most important feature(s) that you leave out other features that may improve your explanation of your model. This is a problem because you want to get the best explanation.\n",

    "Variance means that you are **overfitting**. You are accommodating every single data point that you include features you don't want that may confuse or hurt your explanation of your models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Too much variance:\n",
    "    - Regularization regression models, such as Lasso and Ridge (explained later), will increase bias.\n",
    "    - Dimensionality Reduction (unsupervised learning) and Feature Selection will increase bias.\n",

Decision Trees can be high variance depending on how many leaf nodes you determine in your parameter. This is where research and analyst comes into place. As a scientist, you'll need to go back and forth to achieve the highest optimized trade off point. There is no \"right\" answer.\n",
